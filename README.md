# Mock-Linux-Shell-in-Java
In a team of 4 members we created a mock shell that implements core linux commands. All commits were made on svn and used we used the scrum approach to code this project. This project took around 1.5 months to complete and is now finished.

Project can be run by downloading all files and then compiling JShell.java located in /src/Driver/JShell.java
